DDL - D(eimos) Dynamic Loader
=============================

The D(eimos) Dynamic Loader allows loading dynamic C libraries at run time.
Consult its [API documentation](http://jkm.github.com/ddl/ddl.html) for more
information.

Dependencies
============

On Posix systems you need to link against libdl. libdl's license must permit
linking considering ddl's license. A libdl implementation licensed under LGPL is
fine.

There are no dependencies on Windows systems.

Configure and Build
===================

Don't forget to update the submodules if you haven't cloned recursively.

    $ git submodule init; git submodule update;

Use [premake4](https://bitbucket.org/goughy/premake-dev-d/) to configure ddl.

    $ premake4 gmake
	$ make

Testing
=======

See directory tests/ for some usage examples.

The tests assume that there is the standard C library and the OpenSSL library
installed on your system. Thus, the tests may fail for good reason on your
system. But please report any problem.

	$ make config=tests

Cleaning
========

Clean created binaries

	$ make clean

Clean all created files

	$ premake4 clean
